# Plan

A basic way to track what needs to be done and keep it close to source code.

## Goals

- Provide public documentation about Project U-Turn and getting started information for anyone to be able to start using what's available.
- Clarify the differences between Project U-Turn and React distributions.

## TODO

### components

- [ ] COMP-1: Figure out a component documentation strategy and then configure @umich-lib/components docs-json output ([auto-generated JSON documentation](https://stenciljs.com/docs/docs-json)). Then distribute that JSON, so that it can be consumed, by @umich-lib/docs for example.
- [ ] COMP-2: Consider if Storybook should live within the @umich-lib/components package and not at the root.

### docs

- [ ] DOCS-1: Import @umich-lib/components doc JSON.
- [ ] DOCS-2: Generate component pages.
- [ ] DOCS-3: Create getting started page.

- [ ] DOCS-N: Usability test the docs with an LIT developer.
