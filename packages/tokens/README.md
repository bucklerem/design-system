# @umich-lib/tokens

Design tokens are a tech-agnostic way to store low-level values and then use them to create the styles for your website. Use tokens instead of hard coded values to ensure a scalable, consistent, and sustainable system.

The `@umich-lib/tokens` package is responsible for maintaining those tokens and transforming them into usable formats, such as SCSS and CSS custom variables.
