# @umich-lib/css TODOs

Last updated December 2, 2020

- [x] Create Tailwind Maize Theme file in the distribution. The object is being created in tailwind-theme-maize.js, but it needs to be generated in the dist thru some build script process. This way products can consume the theme and do what they wish with customization.

- [x] Add minification to the umich-lib.css file.

- [ ] Review the tailwind theme config, make sure it has everything, such as font families, breakpoints,

- [ ] Perhaps add a "dev" version? umich-lib.development.css as the uncompressed options.

- [ ] How to present this and use it in DS. Go to tailwindcss.com, we quit.
