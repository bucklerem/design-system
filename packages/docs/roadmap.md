## What we are working on

### Web standards, hello there

When we built Library Search in 2016 and redesigned our Public Website in 2019 with React based technologies we learned a lot of about what works well in design operations and what doesn't, such as the potential of a design system and how to support high-quality design and development.

**Recently**

- We decided on a common CSS strategy.
- We adopted modern web standards such as CSS custom properties and Web Components to distribute design system services.

**Exploring**

- How to create a CSS contribution workflow.
- How to document and share HTML and CSS only solutions (not a Web Component).

### Preserve high-quality designs

We operate many websites and we want our best solutions to be preserved for the next team to apply to their situation. The [Universal Header](/universal-header) came out of the Website Redesign project for example and has been maintained in some form or another since 2018.

**Recently**

- Had a recent round of [Universal Header research](/universal-header/#research) to preserve this design that has been in the works since 2018.

**Exploring**

- More research for Chat and the Website Header.
- Research Website Header needs and try and get it out of experimental status.

### Advocate for digital inclusion

Our websites should work well for everyone. We are committed to [Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility](https://www.lib.umich.edu/about-us/about-library/diversity-equity-inclusion-and-accessibility). If we realize we made a mistake, we will pause to understand the situation, make amends, and release an fix as soon as possible.

**Recently**

- Members of the team are cross-functional and represent a broad range of perspective and expertise.

**Exploring**

- Opportunities for allyship throughout the organization.
