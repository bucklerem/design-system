## Design System Principles

A set of principles underpins all our design decisions and guides us when we need to make hard choices. This criteria is what makes good design at U-M Library and all design patterns are evaluated against it.

### 1. Backed by research

Understanding user needs is central. Our design, development, and content efforts must be based on what real users need â€” what they need to do, what they need to know, and what challenges they may need to overcome. Decisions will be informed by research and by best practices and standards.

### 2. Simple

Less is more. Our visual style is clean and understated. We help users stay focused by using subtle, unobtrusive graphics, standard controls, and predictable behaviors. We offer users a well thought-out path, rather than overwhelming them with choice.

### 3. Robust

Anyone should be able to understand and use our interfaces. Our sites are intuitive, flexible, and resilient. And when we say 'anyone', we mean it. Our products and visual language should be welcoming and accessible for all users, regardless of their age, gender, or device.
